            <h2>About The Luck Lab</h2>
            <p>The Luck Lab is an interactive 3D application designed to explore the concepts of probability and chance through engaging dice rolls and coin flips. Users can interact with various themed 3D models, change environments, and observe random outcomes in a virtual laboratory setting.</p>
            <p>This project utilizes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Three.js library for 3D rendering and interaction. It also uses the GSAP library for animations.</p>

            <h3>3D Models Creation Process (Blender):</h3>
            <p>All 3D models used in this application were created using Blender, focusing on applying modeling, texturing, and exporting techniques relevant to the course.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>D6 Model (die6.glb / die6.blend):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Started with a default Cube mesh. Used the Bevel modifier (applied) for rounded edges.</li>
                        <li>UV unwrapped using Smart UV Project or manual seams.</li>
                        <li>Created a material using the Principled BSDF shader.</li>
                        <li>**Updated Appearance:** Modified material properties to achieve a **clear red** look. This involved:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Setting the Base Color to red.</li>
                                <li>Increasing the `Transmission` value significantly (towards 1.0) to allow light to pass through.</li>
                                <li>Adjusting `Roughness` (lower for clearer, higher for frosted) and potentially `IOR` (Index of Refraction, e.g., ~1.5 for glass/plastic).</li>
                                <li>Ensuring the pips/numbers were applied correctly (perhaps as separate objects or using a texture mask with the main material).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Exported as GLB (Apply Modifiers, UVs, Normals, Materials checked). Source `.blend` file included.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>D12 Model (die12.glb / die12.blend):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Created a Dodecahedron mesh (Add Mesh > Math Function > Regular Solids or manual construction).</li>
                        <li>Applied a slight Bevel modifier to edges.</li>
                        <li>UV unwrapped carefully, marking seams to flatten pentagonal faces.</li>
                        <li>Created a material with a distinct base color.</li>
                        <li>A texture map (1-12) was created and applied to faces via the UV map.</li>
                        <li>Adjusted material properties (Principled BSDF).</li>
                        <li>Exported as GLB with embedded textures. Source `.blend` file included.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Coin Model (coin.glb / coin.blend):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Started with a Cylinder mesh, scaled flat on the Z-axis.</li>
                        <li>Added edge loops and Bevel modifier/manual beveling for a rounded rim.</li>
                        <li>Optionally used Subdivision Surface modifier (low level) for smoothness.</li>
                        <li>UV unwrapped (top, bottom, rim separately).</li>
                        <li>Created material(s) for Heads and Tails using textures/masks.</li>
                        <li>Designed/sourced Heads/Tails images, applied as textures to Base Color.</li>
                        <li>Increased Metallic property and adjusted Roughness for a coin look. Bump map optional.</li>
                        <li>Exported as GLB with embedded textures. Source `.blend` file included.</li>
                    </ul>
